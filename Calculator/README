This directory contains calculator. It's a very simple calculator, not bug-free or
complete in any way ..
It is there to show how to get things done in GTKKit.

It shows some issues:

  - how to use gkm GUI description files
    - how to setup menues
    - how to use target/action and tags with buttons
    - how to instantiate own controller classes and assign outlets from them
  - how to use table-layout
  - how to register for a launch-notification to show up windows
